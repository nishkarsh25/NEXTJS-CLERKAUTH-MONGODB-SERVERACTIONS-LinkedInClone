## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with server-side rendering and routing capabilities.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript for improved developer experience and code quality.
- **App Router**: Next.js's built-in routing system for handling client-side navigation and dynamic routing.
- **oneentry**: API client for interacting with external data sources, used here for fetching blog content.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling components, providing a scalable and maintainable CSS solution.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Tools for code linting and formatting, ensuring consistent code style and catching potential errors.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishkarsh25/NEXTJS-CLERKAUTH-MONGODB-SERVERACTIONS-LinkedInClone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to checkout.
   

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Server Actions

#### getAllPosts

- **Description:** Retrieves all posts stored in the database.
- **Implementation:** This function fetches all posts asynchronously from the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

#### createPostAction

- **Description:** Creates a new post and stores it in the database.

#### likePostAction

- **Description:** Adds a user's like to a specific post.
- **Implementation:** This action updates the likes array for a post document in MongoDB, ensuring that each user can like a post only once.

#### dislikePostAction

- **Description:** Removes a user's like from a specific post.
- **Implementation:** This action removes a user's like from the likes array of a post document in MongoDB, effectively reversing the operation of `likePostAction`.

#### createCommentAction

- **Description:** Posts a new comment on a specific post.
- **Implementation:** This action adds a new comment to the comments array of a post document in MongoDB, associating the comment with the corresponding post.

#### deleteCommentAction

- **Description:** Deletes a comment from a specific post.
- **Implementation:** This action removes a comment from the comments array of a post document in MongoDB, ensuring that only authorized users can delete comments they have posted.

These server actions encapsulate the core functionalities of interacting with posts and comments within the LinkedIn clone application. Each action is designed to manage specific operations related to posts and comments stored in the MongoDB database. Adjustments can be made based on specific business logic and security requirements.
